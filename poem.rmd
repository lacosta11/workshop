## First Verse

Learn well your grammar,  

And never stammar,  

Write well and neatly,  

And sing most sweetly,  

Be enterprising,  

## Second Verse

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
After all the words I have said  

Or behind each thought and rhyme  

I write to catch whatever essence  

Is left of my own existence  

And here I am; I still believe  

Believing that things will not end  

Things eventually become better  
 
And the world moves on silently
